        The defender scored a late winner last Friday against Monza and followed
        that up with another decisive strike, heading home in the 51st minute.
        Napoli had the better of the first half but couldn't make their chances
        count. Victor Osimhen had the opportunity to equalise but was unable to
        capitalise on Wojciech Szczesny's poor kick. The win moves Juventus one
        point clear of Inter Milan at the top of the table. Napoli, meanwhile,
        remain fifth.

      Rightio, that’s pretty much all we’ve got time for. It’s been quite the
      day hasn’t it? From Pep Guardiola’s cat to Roy Hodgson booing himself,
      with a trio of unexpected Manchester United awards in between. Never a
      dull moment. Go and grab yourself a pre-Christmas Friday drink to
      celebrate. I’ll leave you with this piece from Nick Ames with Arsenal’s
      William Saliba. He’ll be taking centre stage tomorrow evening as two of
      the Premier League’s in-form sides meet at Villa Park. Saliba, that is,
      not Nick
